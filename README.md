# Revenue Oracle

Revenue Oracle is a powerful tool designed to assist users in modeling and deciding on product pricing by evaluating potential revenue from Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and consulting businesses under various assumptions. This repository is publicly accessible and can be used commercially under the permissive MIT license.

## Features

- **Flexible Revenue Modeling**: Simulate potential income from multiple revenue streams such as consultancy, low-price SaaS products, and premium SaaS offerings.
- **Customizable Assumptions**: Easily adjust assumptions to tailor the revenue model to your specific needs and business scenarios.

Decide on product pricing by modelling potential Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and consulting revenue under different assumptions.

For example, calculate potential income from three simultaneous revenue streams such as consultancy, a low-price SaaS product, and a premium SaaS product.
